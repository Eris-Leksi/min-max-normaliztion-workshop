#  Housing Data Normalization Project

This project demonstrates manual Min-Max Normalization applied to a housing dataset using only pandas (no `numpy` or `sklearn`). The normalization process is applied to key numerical attributes including price, area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and lot size.

##  Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about residential properties, including the following attributes:

- `House_ID`: Unique identifier for each house
- `Price`: Market price of the house
- `Area_sqft`: Size of the house in square feet
- `Num_Bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms
- `Num_Bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms
- `Year_Built`: Year the house was built
- `Lot_Size`: Size of the lot in acres

This dataset is used to practice feature scaling techniques by normalizing selected features using the **Min-Max normalization** method.
